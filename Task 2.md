<h1>Notebook 2</h1>
<h2>Pytorch Basic ANN</h2>
<p> In this project I have created a basic artificial neural network with 5 hidden layers with each 250 neurons each. I have used <b> Relu activation</b> function for this as I am using <b>CrossEntropyLoss</b>
 <h2> Learning Rate </h2>
 Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, I have reduced the learning rate by a lot and incresed the number of epochs</br>
 I have used <b> Adam as an optimizer and used <b> Cross Entropy Loss Function</b> to calculate losses.
 
  <h2>Plotting</h2>
  <p> I have plotted the number of epochs vs losses. The losses were very minimal compared to the starting og the training.</p>
  
  <h2>Validation</h2>
  <p>The loss came out to be around 91 and the model achieved an accuracy of 90 percent. The model took around 10 hours to run on Kaggle Tesla GPU. I have printed out the predictions of a few cases and compared it to y_test.</p>
